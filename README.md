I have built an interactive Amazon product sales dashboard to analyze the sales trends,customers reviews and category performance.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Power BI (Visualization, Power query, DAX)

- Dynamic filtering by Year, Quarter, and Product Category.
- Sales trends by month and week.
- Top 5 products by sales and reviews.

## 💡Impact:
- Made it easy to see how sales are doing over the year and quarters with the help of filters.
- Showed the sales of product category in a table and top 5 products by YTD sales and YTD reviews.
- Helped to find sales patterns by month and week.
